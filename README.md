# Labwork 6

Objective of the work: to study the principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) inheritance. Implement the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.

Task:
Write a program for bookkeeping in the library. Information about books includes: author's full name, title, year of publication, and the number of copies of the book in the library. Provide selection through a menu and implement the following functions:

- Adding data about newly arriving books to the library.
- Removing data about books being decommissioned.
- Providing information about all books, ordered by authors.
- Providing information about all books, ordered by the year of publication.
Organize data storage using a container class multimap, using the "author's full name" as the key.

During this laboratory work, I studied fundamental concepts (classes, subclasses, and methods) and learned to implement the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.
